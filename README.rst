scientific-computing is built to work with
NumPy arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines,
such as routines for numerical integration and optimization. This library
presents a broad overview of numerical methods for students and professionals
in computationally oriented disciplines who need to solve mathematical
problems. It differs from traditional numerical analysis library such as scipy
in that it focuses on the motivation and ideas behind the algorithms presented
rather than on building a Python wrapper around LAPACK and BLAS.

Numerical methods presented are largest based on academic papers, well-known
books such as

- Scientific Computing: An Introductory Survey by Michael T. Heath
- Numerical Linear Algebra by Lloyd N. Trefethen and David Bau
